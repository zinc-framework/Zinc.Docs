Zinc can create full 2D games, but every game starts with a seed of an idea. Those ideas have to be tested, pushed, and pulled to figure out what _works_, iterating as rapidly as possible to test and verify what _feels_ good.

Zinc knows this, and as such provides you, by default, with a workflow designed to get you up and running as fast as possible. It gets out of your way as you try to throw things together to just build up a sense of what _works_.
