Hello! Welcome to Zinc!

Zinc, as the title says, is a code-only, C#, 2D game framework.

It's a great way to quickly make 2D games that work across Windows/Mac/Linux. It also works on the web!

Zinc is meant to be a game making toolkit for people that have had some experience using other game engines/frameworks, but also is simple enough to learn that it could be used for someone to make their first ever game.

## Basic Setup

To get everything setup, follow the instructions on the [getting started page](../guides/getting-started.md). That will get your developer environment ready to go for making stuff with Zinc.

## First Time Gamedev?

If you're new to creating games, I recommend you _don't_ try to learn everything about Zinc right away. Instead follow along with the [Your First Game](../guides/tutorials/first-game.md) tutorial. This tutorial will walk you through creating a simple side-scrolling space shooter game and get you acclimated with general concepts in Zinc.

## Experienced Gamedev?

If you've got experience creating games, I recommend starting with the [Workflow](../guides/workflow.md) page, as it gives you a rundown of how Zinc kind of wants you to operate at a baseline (but you can obviously diverge!). I also recommend reading the page on [Entities](../concepts/entities.md) to get a sense of how Zinc think about "stuff" in the game.
