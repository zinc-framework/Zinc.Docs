you’ve made some games before in unity, godot, or roblox. you’re more experienced now and you don’t need the engine’s bells and whistles anymore. in fact, they are starting to annoy you. you want something simpler. something that gets out of the way. you don’t even need an editor. a laser-focused 2D API with a few smart design decisions is enough. everything else should be up to you. you can build the tools you need. the framework does the hard stuff, and you just make the game. oh and simple. like, “boot the engine and render a square in one line” simple:

```
Zinc.Engine.Boot(() => new Square());
```

you want zinc.
